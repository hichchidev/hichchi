# README Generator Prompt Template for Junie

This is a comprehensive prompt template for generating high-quality readme-top.md files for npm packages in the Hichchi ecosystem. Use this prompt with Junie to create consistent, professional, and comprehensive documentation.

## PROMPT TEMPLATE

```
Create a comprehensive readme-top.md file for the npm package "@hichchi/[PACKAGE_NAME]" with the following specifications:

### PACKAGE INFORMATION
- Package Name: @hichchi/[PACKAGE_NAME]
- Description: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]
- Technology: [TECHNOLOGY_STACK] (e.g., NestJS, Angular, React, etc.)
- Main Features: [LIST_MAIN_FEATURES]
- Target Use Cases: [PRIMARY_USE_CASES]

### DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
1. **Universal Compatibility**: Design must work on both light and dark backgrounds (GitHub dark mode, npm white background)
2. **Clean & Professional**: Use simple Markdown with minimal HTML, neutral colors
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include all essential sections for professional documentation
4. **Consistent Branding**: Part of the Hichchi ecosystem with consistent styling

### REFERENCE TEMPLATE
Use `libs/nest-auth/readme-top.md` as the reference template for generating the basic layout and structure. This file serves as the gold standard for:

- **Overall Structure**: Follow the same section order and organization
- **Styling Approach**: Use similar formatting, badges, and visual elements
- **Content Organization**: Mirror the way content is presented and structured
- **Markdown Patterns**: Adopt the same markdown formatting conventions
- **Badge Styling**: Use consistent badge colors, styles, and positioning
- **Section Headers**: Follow the same emoji and header formatting patterns
- **Code Block Formatting**: Use similar syntax highlighting and code presentation
- **Footer Structure**: Maintain consistent footer layout and links

**Important**: Adapt the content to be specific to the target package while maintaining the same professional layout and visual consistency established in the nest-auth readme.

### REQUIRED STRUCTURE

#### 1. Header Section
- Clean title with package name and emoji
- Brief, compelling description
- Standard badges: npm version, downloads, license, technology version
- Ecosystem reference: "Part of the Hichchi ecosystem"
- Jump to documentation link

#### 2. Table of Contents
Include all major sections with anchor links for easy navigation

#### 3. Installation
Simple npm install command with clean formatting

#### 4. Quick Start
- Minimal working example
- 2-3 step setup process
- Basic usage code snippet
- Get users up and running in minutes

#### 5. Prerequisites
- Required dependencies and versions
- Peer dependencies with install commands
- Optional dependencies for enhanced features
- System requirements

#### 6. Overview
- Clear value proposition
- What problems it solves
- Key benefits

#### 7. Features
**IMPORTANT**: Focus on user-facing features rather than internal implementation details. Examine the codebase to distinguish between what users actually interact with versus internal components.

Organize features into logical categories based on user perspective:
- **Ready-to-Use Components** - Pre-configured endpoints, controllers, or components users get out-of-the-box
- **Core Functionality** - Main features users directly configure and use
- **Protection & Security** - Guards, middleware, or security features users can apply
- **Helper Tools** - Decorators, utilities, or tools users can use in their own code
- **Configuration Options** - What users can customize and configure
- **Advanced Features** - Optional or advanced capabilities for power users

**Guidelines for Feature Selection**:
- Include features that users directly interact with or configure
- Exclude internal services, pipes, or utilities that are implementation details
- Focus on "what users get" rather than "how it's implemented internally"
- For authentication libraries: emphasize pre-configured endpoints over internal auth services
- For UI libraries: emphasize components users can use over internal utilities
- For utility libraries: emphasize functions users can call over internal helpers

Use descriptive bullet points with emojis and clear explanations that highlight user benefits

#### 8. Usage Examples
**Note**: Usage examples will be different for each library and will be generated with separate prompts. 
When generating the readme-top.md, just include the "üöÄ Usage" section header and placeholder content indicating that detailed examples will be added separately.
