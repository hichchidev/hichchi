/**
 * Interface representing essential user information.
 *
 * The `UserInfo` interface defines the core identifying information for a user
 * that is commonly needed throughout the application. It contains only the essential
 * properties needed to identify and display basic user information, without including
 * sensitive or authentication-related data.
 *
 * This interface is designed to be embedded within other entities for tracking user
 * associations, such as who created or modified a record. It's a lightweight alternative
 * to embedding or referencing the complete user entity.
 *
 * Common use cases:
 * - Audit trails for entity creation and modification
 * - Activity logs showing which user performed an action
 * - User attribution in collaborative features
 * - Display of user information in UI components
 *
 * @see {@link Model} Uses this interface for tracking entity ownership and changes
 * @see {@link EntityId} Type used for the user identifier
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Example of a blog post entity using UserInfo
 * interface BlogPost {
 *   id: EntityId;
 *   title: string;
 *   content: string;
 *   author: UserInfo;  // The user who wrote the post
 *   lastEditedBy?: UserInfo;  // The user who last edited the post
 * }
 * ```
 */

     * The user's complete name, typically a combination of first and last name.
