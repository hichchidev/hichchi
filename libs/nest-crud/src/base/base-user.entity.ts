/**
 * Base user entity class that provides common user fields and functionality
 *
 * This class extends BaseEntity and implements the UserInfo interface, providing
 * the core user properties required for user identification and display. It serves
 * as the foundation for all user-related entities in the application, ensuring
 * consistent structure and behavior across different user types.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Provides firstName, lastName, and fullName properties required by UserInfo
 * - Automatically maintains the fullName property based on firstName and lastName
 * - Inherits all audit tracking capabilities from BaseEntity
 *
 * Application-specific user entities should extend this class and add additional
 * properties as needed, such as email, password, roles, etc.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * @HichchiEntity("users", ["email"])
 * export class UserEntity extends HichchiUserEntity implements User {
 *   @Column({ nullable: false })
 *   email: string;
 *
 *   @Column({ nullable: true })
 *   password?: string;
 *
 *   @Column({ default: false })
 *   emailVerified: boolean;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @implements {UserInfo} Provides the core user identification properties
 * @see {@link UserInfo} The interface that defines the required user properties
